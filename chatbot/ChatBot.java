The content is rendered by web browsers, and HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and styled web pages.");
frontend.put("css", "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of a web page. It allows developers to apply styles to HTML elements, controlling aspects like color, layout, typography, and spacing. CSS is crucial for creating visually appealing and responsive web designs. With CSS, developers can use classes, IDs, and selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply design rules. CSS also supports advanced features like animations and media queries.");
frontend.put("javascript", "JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to a web page. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are static, JavaScript enables real-time interaction, such as responding to user inputs, updating content, and validating forms. JavaScript runs in the user's browser, making it an essential tool for client-side development. It works with the DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate HTML elements, offering functionalities like event handling, AJAX, and animation effects.");
